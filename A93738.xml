            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHilſt I was in the courſe of my Ministry, as if I had ſpoken Prophetically, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of anticipation on the Lords day fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, I had Occaſion to mention how that when <hi>Eldad and Medad did Propheſie in the camp, Joſhua the Son of Nun, the ſervant of Moſes, one of his young Men anſwered and ſaid, my Lord, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes forbid them,</hi> I did thereupon Remark in theſe very words, Thoſe who now a days get their living by the Trade of Preaching, do think and talk after the like manner, it is Pity ſuch an one ſhould be ſuffered, the Juſtices of the Peace, and civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould forbid him, (which Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is coutrary unto that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Numbers 11. 28, 29. Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. 19.)</hi> and it ſeems to have been literally fulfilled in the ſame following week: for as I have good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to believe and underſtand, that he was put in mind and Inſtigated ſo to do, by ſome of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wordly Priesthood: (for there is alſo a wordly Sanctuary, <hi>Heb. 9. 1.</hi> and a wordly kind of Religion at this day; Behold there came a ſudden and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexpected order from the chief Man of the Pariſh to the owner of the Houſe wherein I
<pb facs="tcp:152396:3"/> Preached, forbidding my Preaching or Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more in that place. But when I told my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof, I ſaid and promiſed that for my part, I would <hi>fear no more. nor be diſmayed nor be lacking.</hi> Jer. 23. 4. But if he had continued in forbidding, (which Bleſſed be God for changing his heart he did not,) I would have came to the Houſe nevertheleſs at the time appointed, and there have appeared in Perſon for a ſign and witneſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting whither only two or three would have came to enquire whither the Word of the Lord was Preached there or not; And if any one beſides would have lent a Room elſewhere, or if any People would have stood by, as Jeſus ſat on the Well. <hi>Joh. 4. 6.</hi> and did there talk the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God with the woman of <hi>Samaria.</hi> And as it ſhall be ſaid in the day of Judgment, that He <hi>taught in our ſtreets.</hi> Luk. 13. 26. which was either when the People would not admit him or Miniſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Houſes, (for Christ teaches by his Miniſters at this day) or perhaps they did chooſe to <hi>Teach in the ſtreets,</hi> on Purpoſe for the more Publick manner, and Notification thereof, that it might <hi>turn to them for a Teſtimony.</hi> Luk. 21. 13. and for the ſake of commonly a Greater concourſe of People, Or as Paul went to the Sea ſhore, where Prayer uſed to be made, and ſeveral reſorted unto him, and there he ſat down and ſpoke unto the People. Even ſo I had thought, purpoſed and reſolved within my ſelf, in ſome place or other, or ſome way or other, even in the most orderly manner as the neceſſity of ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:152396:3"/> caſe would have permitted, <hi>to read out of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Roll.</hi> Jer. 36. 6. (from whence note that Reading of Sermons is both lawfull and acceptable with God,) and alſo to haue ſpoken without book, ſuch words as the Lord and his Spirit had put into my Mouth, and furniſhed me withall.</p>
            <p>And though what doth exceed common Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, or what is ſomewhat unuſual, is Eſteemed by the mixt Multitude and Generality of People for Madneſs or Craſineſs, (which would have con<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Reproach that hath been ſo common in the Mouths of many People, and perhaps ſome of mine Adverſaries would have been glad of my ſhewing ſuch an occaſion thereof,) yet this is to think and talk after the manner of Men; for notwithſtanding that Reproach, yet what is exactly according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of God, and the Scriptures of Truth in ſuch a caſe, I ought to have done it nevertheleſs, and to have left the Iſſue and Event to God, who would have rehearſed up the ſame, and have rolled off that Rebuke from his Servant and Miniſter, in the day when he writeth up the people. It is a certain rule, and always to be obſerved, that when we are in the way of Duty, we ought in no wiſe to leave that undone Out of <hi>fear of the Reproach of Men, and in being afraid of their revilings</hi> Iſa. 51. 7. or for their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, kind of ſayings, let them be what they will.</p>
            <p>But the Proof and Tryal of this did not come ſo far, for as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Laban, God hath ſeen mine Affliction, and the labour of mine hands, and Rebuked thee yeſter night.</hi> Gen. 31. 42. ſo altho'
<pb facs="tcp:152396:4"/> he did ſend ſuch an order, perhaps in a fit of Paſſion <hi>(the wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God:)</hi> yet probably upon ſecond thoughts and conſideration of the exceeding Peril and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hindering the word of the Lord, it being no leſs then ſhuting out of Heaven, in as much as God will not ſuffer them to Reign with him in Glory, who would not have him reign over them here on Earth, by his word, and thoſe whom He ordains and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points for the Preaching and Ministration thereof. for indeed unleſs I was ſent and ordained by God. I could no more Preach nor yet make and compoſe Sermons, then I can now ſpeak any the moſt strange language which I understand not. But this is a call and evidence of <hi>Gods putting into the Miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath enabled me.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 12. for it. Here is an anſwer, to that vain objection and bare contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of many People. Or perhaps God did ſee mine Affliction herein alſo, (for I was very much Afflicted at the hearing of ſuch an order, and it was to me as if I had been cut or ſtruck at the heart,) and the labour of mine hands among ye, and he was willing to continue it a little longer, and therefore God rebuked him by ſilent and inward thoughts to his Soul, for ſo it was that he did not continue to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbid and hinder, but he ſeem'd to intimate that I might again proceed on in my Miniſtry as I do this day.</p>
            <p>As this was the true occaſion of my first compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this following Sermon, or diſcourſe: ſo of the Publiſhing thereof, let this reaſon be aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </hi> So the enſuing Treatiſe is a <hi>Word in Seaſon,</hi> that is, proper and ſuitable unto the preſent Generation. For as heretofore, Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, was to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs: ſo even now we live in an Age and Country, wherein the Doctrin of the Croſs, and the Du ty of Christian ſuffering hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded. and eſteemed folly and thereupon to little Practiſed even by ſuch as hold faſt the name of Chriſt but they have denied his Faith. Which hath ſo come to paſs, becauſe of, the Tranſgreſſions and contrary doings of Men, who have made their choice, rather to Sin, then to Suffer; but notwithſtanding that, yet ſtill it is expected from ſuch who are indeed the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God, <hi>He that hath my Word, let him ſpeak my Word Fiath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> Jer. 23. 28. <hi>Moreover it is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 2.) eſpecially in ſuch a Time, when People are ſo very much corrupt and gone aſide from the ſame, (for this would be to ſhew unto them, the paths of Life: O, that they would walk therein,) nevertheleſs to Teach and affirm conſtantly <hi>the Truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Peradventure, God would give unto ſuch Repentance to the Ackowledging of the Truth; and that they recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

            <p>TRuly, there are but few now a days of that mind, who care to go to Heaven that way, <hi>That ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye alſo ſuffer.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 5. (By the way, It is one thing to be worldly Wiſe, but another to be wiſe unto Salvation.) But the Opinion of the worldly Wiſe, and outward Worſhippers, yea, and of moſt who are called Chriſtians at this day, is, That if they only ſhall be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God who ſuffer for it; or if they <hi>muſt enter therein through much Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Acts 14, 22. God may keep his Kingdom to himſelf as to them; for they do not care to go to Heaven that way: But it is truly ſaid of ſuch in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which is fulfilled at this day, and in this Country of ours, <hi>Take heed, regard not Iniquity, for this thou haſt choſen rather than Affliction,</hi> Job 36. 20. When they ſee, orperceive, or do but apprehend, yea, in moſt caſes, falſly ſurmiſe, that the Croſs of Perſecution is coming upon them; as when they took hold of the young Man
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152396:6"/> by his Cloaths, he left his Cloaths, and fled away nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even ſo now too many will <hi>deny Chriſt</hi> (as the denying of any part of the Word and Commandment of God, is denying of Chriſt, inaſmuch as Chriſt is the Word of God) to avoid Shame, the Croſs, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Now if any deny Chriſt before Men, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to to own and confeſs any part of God's Word, ſuch an one denies Chriſt; and him will Chriſt deny before his Father which is in Heaven. Truly and in ſad earneſt, ſuch people will never be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which they do not care, nor will they ſuffer. If any are of this mind, who ſhall Hear or Read theſe Lines, I am to declare and make known to ſuch, That there is ſomewhat wanting in them, which is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. I mean, a willingneſs to take up and ſubmit unto the Croſs when we are in the way of Duty, and of ſerving God, as the Hearing of his Word certainly is. Saith Chriſt, <hi>He that taketh not up his Croſs, and followeth aftar me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Mat. 10. 38. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily and follow me.</hi> Luk. 9. 23. So that it is not ſufficient to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Afflictions of the Goſpel once in our Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time (O my Soul, conſider this throughly, and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.) But the Croſs is to be taken up <hi>daily,</hi> at all Times, and throughout our Life, if we would indeed follow Jeſus in the Regeneration, and if we would have our Souls when we die be where he is, even in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am,</hi> John 17. And then we ſhould follow him now, <hi>That as Jeſus was, ſo we may be in this World.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fearful and all lyars ſhall have their part in the Luke, which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> Rev. 21. 8. The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and all lyars. That is, ſuch as are afraid to ſpeak out, and bear Witneſs unto the Truth, for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152396:6"/> Men, or of Temporal Inconveniences and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And Lyars, theſe here meant are ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, prevaricate, and <hi>pervert the Thing that is right.</hi> Who ſpeak contrary unto, or different from their own Conſciences, and the Sentiments of their own Mind at the very time to pleaſe rich People, and to ſay as they ſay. Which is a ſinful and wrong thing, although it be never ſo much practiſed abroad in the World, even by the Religious alſo, to the ſhame and ſcandal of pure and undefiled Religion. To ſet our Souls in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we die, is to endeavour that there be nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. But in the Souls of ſuch here ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, there is wanting the Spirit of Boldneſs, Truſt, and the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. They want that <hi>Boldneſs,</hi> which we read ſeveral times in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was in them the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, and of thoſe who did Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Hear them. Notwithſtanding the Heathen did rage, and the Rulers of the Earth did ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed <hi>Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very couragious to keep and to do all that is written in the Law of Moſes, that ye turn not aſide there from to the Right hand, or to the Left.</hi> Joſh. 23, 6. So at this very day, and in this Countrey of ours, which is called Chriſtian, but too many Anti-chriſtian Practices do abound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ſay and teſtify, that people muſt be very <hi>courageous</hi> to keep and to do all that is written in the Goſpel of Chriſt, that they turn not aſide there from to the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, nor yet to the left: that is, not to one wrong Extream, nor yet to the other. If they will indeed fulfil his laſt Commandment which he is recorded to have given in Commiſſion unto his Diſciples, <hi>To preach unto all Nations, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you.</hi> Mat. 28. 20. But if people are for the keeping ſome of the Commandments of God and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152396:7"/> of Chriſt, and not of others, as this is the manner and uſage every where; and this is the very Reaſon, by their <hi>conſenting with the Deed of them</hi> (which is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame Sin and Guilt. <hi>Pſal. 50. 18. Luk. 23. 57. 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 22.) and by their <hi>over-paſſing the Deeds of the Wciked.</hi> Jer. 5. 28. That the Churches have Reſt, and Liberty of outward Worſhip. This is one thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. But at the laſt Day of Judgment, God will not accept of meerly Acts of outward Worſhip, nor yet a partial Obſervation of his Law; for this will not be a Religion to the ſaving of the Soul. But as long as People are in this ignorant corrupt World, they are for keeping ſome of the Commandments of God, and neglecting others, the Devil holding all people by one catch or another. And to do this, there is not ſo much need of Courage, as of Cunning; That is, to know and diſcern, which of the Commandments of God are fit for them to obſerve, and which to neglect, in order to pleaſe Men, get Gain, or ſerve a worldly Intereſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. However ſuch are called or counted Wiſe in their Generation, yet in the end of Time, and at the Diſtribution and Reſtitution of all things, they will be both pronounced, and alſo found Fools. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe it is, as heretofore Chriſt crucified was to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs; ſo even at this day, that Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to it, the thing of Loſs and Inconvenience is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Folly by thoſe who hold faſt the Name of Chriſt. For they ſay of ſuch an one who hath ſubjected himſelf to Loſs, Trouble and Suffering, by following the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of God's written Word, and the Dictates of his own Conſcience, this or that Man is a Fool in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But themſelves do rather hereby ſhew, that notwithſtanding they do hold faſt the Name of Chriſt, yet they have denied the Faith; for if they had but Faith, they would never think or talk after that manner, That when God promiſes, <hi>For your ſhame you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152396:7"/> ſhall have double</hi> (that is, double Honour) <hi>and for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they ſhall rejoyce in their Portion: therefore in their Land they ſhall have their Double, everlaſting joy ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> Iſa. 61. 7. This is to Recompence and make Amends for whatever Loſs, Grief, or Sorrow they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſuſtained in ſerving of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, There is no man that hath left Houſe, Brethren, or Siſters, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for my ſake. or the Goſpel.</hi> (Now what is for the ſake of the Word of God, is both for Chriſt's ſake, and alſo for the Goſpel.) <hi>But he ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this time,</hi> (that is, the ſame or like ſhall be made up unto him in this World: Behold herein the Goodneſs of God, but there is need of Truſt and Faith on him for it, or otherwiſe it will not be had) <hi>Houſes, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Mothers, and Children, and Lands</hi> (God will at preſent ſupply all this by his other Creatures. I have by Experience found it ſo, when my Father did forſake me, the Lord did take me up and provide for me by the Miniſtration of his other Servants. Bleſſed be his Name for it, ſo that I am become an experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Witneſs, which is the beſt and moſt ſatisfactory kind of any) <hi>with Perſecutions;</hi> (theſe alſo have continued, but they were alſo much ſweetned) <hi>and in the World to come Eternal Life.</hi> Mat. 10. 29, 30. As when <hi>Samuel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <hi>Saul,</hi> he confirmed the ſame by foretelling of three Signs. <hi>And let it be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>When theſe Signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occaſion ſhall ſerve thee, for God is with thee.</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 7. Which Signs exactly ſo came to paſs, and were fulfilled according as he had foretold, as may be ſeen throughout that Chapter. Even ſo it is a certain Rule, to be ſurely believed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly depended upon, That where God promiſes to do ſome things in this Life, and ſome things in the Life to come, as this precious Promiſe of <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152396:8"/> made up of both, then if God performs and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the things promiſed in this Life, this is an Earneſt and Pledge in hand, that his other words will be alſo <hi>fulfilled in their ſeaſon.</hi> Luk. 1. 20. And God having already done this for me (Bleſſed, and ever bleſſed be his Divine Goodneſs for the ſame.) This is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and aſſmed evidence unto me, that he will give me in the world to come Eternal Life. As alſo it doth confirm me abundantly, and ſatisfy me clearly, that notwithſtanding I do bear in my Boſom the Reproaches of the Mighty People, that I have been and am indeed a doing the Work of the Lord all along. <hi>By this I know that thou favoureſt me, becauſe mine Enemy doth not triumph over me.</hi> Pſal. 41. 11. By this I know that thou, O God, haſt had a work for me to do in the Great and Populous City of this Nation, becauſe that I have lived there upon thy Providence, and Providing, and the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Servants, when I had not in my Purſe and Scrip, as from my Kindred according to the Fleſh, what would maintain or provide for me three Weeks, or three Days. It is agreeable to the method and doings of God, to ſend out his Extraordinary Meſſengers and Diſciples with a <hi>Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Braſs in your Purſes.</hi> Mat. 10 9. And when I went out, I had not ſufficient both for my Journey and Stay there, tho' I can withal make the ſame Return, that when God and Chriſt ſent me out thus, Lackeſt thou any thing? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing abſolutely neceſſary, for I have fed to the Full, and to the ſatisfying of my Soul, and yet much more to the Peace of my Conſcience, that when I have been at my Father's Table. I do on purpoſe here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and make known what Lord hath done for my Soul. <hi>And he hath put a new Song in my mouth, even praiſes unto our Lord; Many ſhall ſee it, and fear and truſt in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 40. 23. That they who ſhall hear or read this, may learn and remember from ſuch a poor and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152396:8"/> mean Example as now writeth this, whom God hath carried through and preſerved all along, <hi>He brought me alſo out of an horrible Pit</hi> (where in a Litteral ſenſe Men did ride and trample over mine Head) <hi>and out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The Sixth Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> throughout is mighty full, pertinent, and expreſs to this purpoſe, where the Devil had a mind to raiſe Perſecution againſt <hi>Daniel.</hi> Which the Great God over all ſuffered, to prove his Servant. And thereupon Satan frames a Device to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten <hi>Daniel</hi> from praying unto God, by threatning him with the Lions Den. <hi>But when Daniel knew that the Writing was ſigned, he went into his Houſe, and his window being open in his Chamber towards Jeruſalem.</hi> (One would think he might have ſhut it then, and Prayed ſoftly to himſelf, and lock'd his Chamber door, that none ſhould ſee or hear him to give the leaſt Information. But Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truſt, and the Fear of God made him to do thus. For it is here Recorded, <hi>He kneeled down upon his Knees three times a day, and Prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</hi> Ver. 10. Well, what is the Conſequent hereof? He is put in the Lions Den, yea, and taken out of it again alive, ſafe and ſound: The Text going going on to add in an obſervable manner, <hi>So Daniel was taken out of the Lions Den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, becauſe he believed on his God.</hi> Ver. 23.

            <p>The Promiſes of preſent Comfort, Stay and Support, and alſo of the future Recompence are ſo full and many throughout the whole Book of God, which are annexed to the ſuſtaining any Loſs or Suffering for his ſake, his Word, and Worſhip, that we may be perſwaded of them, and embrace them, yea and act accordingly (if all along we do according to the revealed Will of God, and <hi>we ſee to it that our matters are good and right.</hi> Sam. 15. 3.) ſo that if we fall into them, and thus come in for Sharers and Partakers both of the preſent and future Benefits, which God that cannot lye, hath promiſed to them that Suffer, or are Perſecuted for his ſake, his Name or Word, In all this and the like, <hi>the Spirit of God and of Glory reſteth on us, and let us not be aſhamed, but let us glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Sirs! Miſtake not, nor yet deceive your ſelves. The way to Heaven is the very ſame as it was in the Days of Old, or antient Times. <hi>No Croſs, no Crown,</hi> no reigning with God hereafter, unleſs we Suffer for him here. The Scripture is expreſs to this Purpoſe. <hi>But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are Partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> Heb. 12. 8. <hi>Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer Perſecution.</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 12. Whoſever even in theſe days will ſtrictly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally obſerve all his Laws and Directions; who is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to keep a good Conſcience in all things; Who will reprove Sin in his Brethren and Neighbours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is commanded in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. and do this indefinitely, without Reſpect of Perſons, not thinking that rich People ſin more excuſeably than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor yet are they allowed to tranſgreſs, but they ought to obey the Word of God all one as the Poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and <hi>reprove them ſharply.</hi> Not mincing or ſoftning the Matter, as the Reproof of old <hi>Eli</hi> was to his Sons; for which the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>He reſtrained them not.</hi> But whoſoever is zealous for his God, and will approve him to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152396:9"/> himſelf only, and not as unto Men, ſuch even in our hypocritical Times ſhall endure Perſecution or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and other worldly Loſſes and Inconveniences. But as for thoſe that ſeem to be Religious, and make a fair ſhew in the Fleſh, who may obſerve ſome of the Laws and Directions of Chriſt, but not all of them; and who are for keeping a good Conſcience in ſome things, but not in all things; who are for pleaſing and flattering rich People, and walk according to the courſe of this World, and in the way of the Multitude, and they are of that Phariſaical Temper, as to <hi>juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before men.</hi> Luk. 16. 15. and they make it their Chiefeſt care to ſeem outwardly Religious and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſuch indeed and the like may (as the falſe Prophets were of old, to whom a wo was pronounced for this Reaſon) <hi>Be well ſpoken of by all men,</hi> or at leaſt by the Generality of the world; although they will not be well thought of by the Saints of the moſt High; for theſe know and diſcern their Hypocriſie and partial Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the ſeveral Churches, and the People of different Perſwaſions at this day have external Reſt and free Liberty of outward worſhip, is becauſe they conſent and partake with other Men's Sins; and becauſe they do not ſtand up and are zealous for all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. But if they once did thus, or if they did but once begin to Reprove Spiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sin, Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Hypocriſie in High Places, the Devil would quickly go out again <hi>to make war with them which keep the Commandments of God</hi> Rev. 12. 17. And he would raiſe Strife, Oppoſition and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt them.

               </gap> yet hath God ty'd him up, as appears by thoſe manifold Tranſgreſſions and mighty Sins, which are now done abroad in the world.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152396:10"/>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was a Saint and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God in his Generation, that in his journeying he came to an Inn, where calling for the Inn-keeper, and beginning to diſcourſe with him (by the way, the Talk of people was then more Divine, ſerious and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying than it is now a days) when the Inn-keeper told him he had never any Affliction in his Life, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thereupon immediately remov'd his Quarters from that Houſe, concluding within himſelf, that ſuch an one was no good Man, nor yet had the favour of God. He judged otherwiſe than the world judgeth now; for they would look upon this to be an eſpecial mark of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. But truly herein the people of the world do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the manner of God's dealing towards the Children of Men; For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we look into the glaſs of the Word, we ſhall there ſee and find, that preſent Impunity and Proſperity are rather ſigns that ſuch, who have them, are Baſtards, than the Children of God; That they <hi>are men of the world who have their portion in this Life.</hi> Pſal. 17. 14. from whom <hi>David</hi> prays by the Spirit, that his Soul may be delivered, and not be with them. Which is alſo the deſire of thoſe who have Faith, and true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the Things and Diſpenſations of God.

               </gap>6. As for my part, when I ſee or hear of any who have the Name or Character of very religious and honeſt People; and yet they never did, nor do lie under Perſecution or Reproach; if they be not afflicted one way or another, nor yet ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by ſome or other, verily I do ſuppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch to be either Hypocrites, or rather partial Chriſtians, ſuch as keep ſome of the Commandments of God, and neglect others. The reaſon whereof is this, becauſe I know not how to reconcile the State of ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152396:10"/> People unto the Scriptures of Truth. For if any be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Perſecution or Reproach, Affliction or Chaſtiſement (whereof all the Servants of God in all Generations and Countries have been Partakers.) Either the Scriptures are not true which ſpeak univerſally of ſome kind of Affliction or Hatred to all God's people (which would be horrid blaſphemy to affirm; for Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, rather than one tittle or jota thereof ſhall fail, until all be fulfilled) or rather, which is the very Truth, ſuch people who thus eſcape ſcotfree from any Trouble or Vexation from the World, are none of the People, Saints, and Servants of God; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they outwardly ſeem or pretend never ſo much to be ſo. After that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt (who had the Character from God, that he was his beloved Son) had with excellent Arguing, ſhewed the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, that the World ſhould hate Him or his Diſciples in <hi>John</hi> 15. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. He ſums up, and concludes that whole Diſcourſe with this obſervable Truth, <hi>But this cometh to paſs that the Word might be fulfilled, which is written in their Law, they hated me without a cauſe.</hi> Ver. 25. And ſo it comes to paſs even now (for the Scriptures hold alike true as to all Perſons, Times, and Places) That there is no going to Heaven, or entring into the Kingdom of God without ſome tribulation or other. Yea, it muſt be of that kind of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation alſo which ariſes from matters of Duty, and from true Serving of and obedience to God. For if it were not, or ſhould not be ſo, the Scriptures would not be fulfilled and found true. Good God! what a ſtrange kind of ignorant and corrupt World do we live in? Many of my Countrey Men and Neighbours <hi>(I was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach among all mine Enemies, but eſpecially among my Neighbours, and a Fear to mine Acquaintance.</hi> Pſal. 31. 11.) have been, and are offended at him, who writeth this, meerly becauſe he hath gone through a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152396:11"/> deal of Trouble, as if he was therefore an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a Deceiver, or deceived in his Religion. Which was the very ſame Surmiſe and Reproach, that thoſe his two called Friends had of, and faſtened on <hi>Job.</hi> As to which, God himſelf witneſſeth on his behalf; <hi>They have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, as my ſervant Job hath.</hi> Job 42. 5. And ſo it is as to the aforementioned Imagination and Saying, That ſuch an one is an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or Deceived, or ſilly and fooliſh, as to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Religion, becauſe his Religion hath occaſioned Suffering and Trouble unto him. Whereas in deed and in truth this Reproach turns upon themſelves. For if judgment be made hereof by the ſure Word of God, This argues, yea and demonſtrates themſelves to be Hypocrites or deceived; as certainly all thoſe are who obey but a part thereof, and not the whole Law of God Yea and fools, in that they loſe the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, promiſed unto Suffering for Well-doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who ſo order their Religion, that it coſts them nothing of Expence, Trouble, or Inconveniency. Whoſe Religion ſits ſo loſe upon them, that they faſhion, and turn, and change it according to every wind of Temptation and Trial; that they may have it always in their back, and to blow with them. Who love to ſwim with the ſtream, although it tends to the bottomleſs Pit Who are for walking all along, or for the moſt part according to the courſe of this World, and to do as moſt do, altho' as ſure as Scripture is true, this is the ready way to be condemned with the World. True indeed, that many times it is moſt for the preſent ſafety and eaſe of the Fleſh, To walk in the way of the Multitude, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this World, but only this is not the right way to Heaven. Of which they will not be counted worthy by God, or by Chriſt now, nor will they be admitted by them hereafter who are afraid, or certainly thoſe will not who refuſe to Suffer for his Name, and for the Teſtimony of his Word, or for the Hearing or Receiving thereof.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152396:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> In that kind of People, who when Tribulation or Perſecution ariſeth for the Word, either before, or immediately afterwards they are offended, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanting in them (and ſo their Souls are not ſet in order as yet, before the time draws nigh, that they muſt die, and go out of theſe Bodies.) That is, they want the <hi>Truſt on God.</hi> Now this Word, <hi>Truſt,</hi> is a relative Term, and preſuppoſes ſome Danger or Difficulty. For as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proves, that the Object of Hopes is unſeen things, by this kind of Arguing; <hi>For what a man ſees, what doth he hope for?</hi> Intimating thereby, as if ſeeing was a kind of Knowledge and Certainty of ſuch things; which is ſomewhat more, and another diſtinct thing from Hope. So here in like manner it may be Reaſoned, if there was no Danger or Difficulty in ſuch a thing, How could we truſt on God concerning it? For the truſt on God is not altogether ſo much to be exerciſed when we are walking in a Room, or when we are at Eaſe in our Houſe, at a full Table, or in the midſt of Health, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Proſperity; or when we are in a whole Skin, and have the World at will. I wiſt that moſt, yea all People can truſt on God then. But herein is the true Excellency and Benefit (for only thus the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Good thereof are to be had) of truſting on God, <hi>When the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yeild no Meat, the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> Hab. 3. 17, 18. And ſo this is the Praiſe and Reward of truſting on God (for it goes beyond that kind of Truſting on God which the people of the world have) when we can truſt on God in deep Poverty, Sickneſs, or Impriſonment, under Loſſes, and the Oppoſition and Hatred of the World againſt us for our Duty, and for our Faithfulneſs unto and ſerving of God, then if we can ſay, yea, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152396:12"/> aſſent unto it in our Hearts, it is a good God whom we ſerve. When we find and perceive from within our ſelves all thoſe outward Evils ſweetned unto us by the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter. And when all this is come upon us, we have not, nor yet will we deal falſly in thy Covenant, nor put forth our hands unto Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, nor commit Sin, nor yet omit Duty, if we might be redreſſed and relieved from out of all of it. Truly, there is Faith and Truſt in this. Faith, that God hath provided better things for us if we hold on in our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Integrity.

               </gap>igh conſume and deſtroy us (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I am almoſt conſumed, but I have not forgotten thy Law)</hi> and make us to periſh, yet we know and hope, that God will make a way for our eſcape (without our ſinful complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or conſenting with the deed of them) and work out deliverance for us by ſome means or other; or if we ſhould die and loſe our Life in them, that he will raiſe up this Life, and we ſhall again find this ſame Life in the Reſtitution of all things, to which will be further graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Life Eternal. When we can truſt God ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave (for this is further than we can now ſee him) that if we ſhould die ſooner in his ſervice, and by doing his Work, for poſſibly he might ſuffer us to live longer in neglecting of it.) But then to hold on, and be verily perſwaded ſo as to act accordingly, That it would be better for us, if the Will of God ſo be, than to have a longer Reſpit and Reprieve. This in very deed ſeems to be the ſuperlative and higheſt Degree of all, and the greateſt Inſtance of truſting on God, which can be, when we love not our Lives unto the Death; But we are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of the Number of them who are <hi>ſlain for the Word of God, and the Teſtimony which they hold.</hi> Rev. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome talkative Chriſtians uſe this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture-Phraſe in their Mouth, <hi>That God may be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152396:12"/> glorified in them, whether it be by Life, or by Death.</hi> But herein is the Labour and Buſineſs, this indeed is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Praiſe thereof, and in truth it is a real truſt on God, to undergo and ſubmit to the ſame. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and firſt Chriſtians did juſt mention that Saying, but they did alſo ſet their Seal to it, even the Seal of their Blood. So they were doers of that Word, more than talkers thereof. Whereas thoſe, who now a days ſeem to be Religious, do alſo uſe this Saying in their Mouth, but for themſelves to experience and witneſs the ſame, if an hour of Trial ſhould come, they would endeavour as much to excuſe or decline it; although it be by the way of Sin, or omiſſion of Duty. But give me the Man that is for doing, is moſt certainly the mind of God, as we may gather from his written Word, and and we alſo learn the ſame, becauſe ſuch is the mind of his Reaſonable Creatures, who come moſt near to the likeneſs of God in Knowledge and Underſtanding, and of being without fear.</p>
            <p>I might make a whole Sermon in Quoting and Amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together thoſe manifold Scriptures (as indeed there are very many of them throughout the whole Book of the Lord) which explain and confirm that Great Duty of Truſt on God, in the ſame Senſe and Meaning afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. As indeed the very Nature of the thing is ſuch, That there can be no proper Truſt, unleſs there is ſome Hazard, or ſeeming and appearing Danger and Difficulty. But that place of <hi>Habakkuk.</hi> 3. 17, 18. aforecited, is ſufficient to confirm the truth of this Obſervation. How exceeding full is the whole Book of Pſalms in the Bible Tranſlation eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of Promiſes to this thing of truſting on God. <hi>The Lord alſo will be a refuge for the oppreſſed, a refuge in Times of Trouble, and they that know thy Name will put their Truſt in thee, for thou Lord haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi> Pſal. 9. 9. 10. <hi>Bleſſed is that man that maketh the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152396:13"/> Lord his Truſt, and reſpecteth not the Proud, nor ſuch as turn aſide to Lyes.</hi> Pſal. 40. 4. By the latter part of which Verſe, we may ſee and learn, that to have reſpect unto Perſons, or to give deference unto Man, or to give way unto Sin, or to turn aſide to Falſhood; all this and the like is quite oppoſite and contrary unto the making the Lord our Truſt. But that that Man is bleſſed, who maketh the Lord his Truſt, we have it not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed here, but almoſt in every one of the <hi>Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty Pſalms.</hi> Eſpecially yet more in thoſe who have the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Inſcription</hi> of, <hi>A Pſalm of David.</hi> Therein is more ſaid hereof (conſidering the like Quantity and Proportion of Words) than in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or in the Writings of the <hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Though all theſe alſo are ſufficiently fraught with Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Promiſes, made and annexed to the truſting on God. Why did <hi>David</hi> the ſweet Singer of Iſrael harp more upon that String than others? For indeed both the <hi>Book of Pſalms,</hi> and alſo the whole Book of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Matter thereof is a well tun'd Cymbal. The reaſon hereof ſeems to be this, becauſe that <hi>David</hi> wrote and penn'd theſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> during the time he was under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Affliction. <hi>(Saul became David's enemy continually.</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 23.) and the Perſecution of <hi>Saul.</hi> And God being all along with him then (for as God was with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in the Priſon, ſo he is much, or rather more by his Spirit with his Servants in <hi>Trouble,</hi> than when they are out of it.) By the ſame Spirit he made known unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> thoſe his manifold precious Promiſes and Truths concerning <hi>Trouble, Affliction,</hi> and ſuch like. How we ſhould behave our ſelves under it until God gives De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and what good things he will give to ſuch as have been exerciſed thereby, to make amends for the evil they have had. For this very ſame Reaſon, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets who have ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, are ſet forth for an Example of ſuffering Affliction, and of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:152396:13"/> The Lord God in his manifold and wonderful Wiſdom having on purpoſe ſuffered Affliction to be laid on their Loins, that they might the better ſpeak forth in the Name of the Lord his <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. The belief whereof made themſelves to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Examples of Patience under it. For there is no ſuch Speaking or Preaching of any thing; as experimental Speaking or Preaching, when what we have ſeen with our Eyes, we have looked upon, our Hands have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; yea yet further, what we have experienced and felt from within and in our ſelves, we declare unto ye. <hi>Behold we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the Patience of Job.</hi> James 5 11. who for this Cauſe alſo ſeems to have undergone all thoſe Great Sufferings, that he might the better hereby ſpeak and declare true Words and right Words concerning thoſe ſame Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and of that <hi>Truſt</hi> on the inviſible God, which is proved and exerciſed therein; which he hath accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo done. Let us hear ſome of his excellent Words. <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go; my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live. Though I die, I will not remove mine Integrity from me; Though He</hi> (viz. <hi>God) ſlay me, yet will I truſt on him.</hi> This again confirms the truth of what was afore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſpoken concerning what truſt on God means. And what ſhall we ſay more on this Subject? <hi>Ye have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy.</hi> By the Examples of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> both whoſe latter End was more than their Beginning; Yea, I will add yet furher that by the end of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> who were kill'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſawn aſunder, as they ſpoke in the Name of the Lord. When we ſhall ſee (which is yet to come) at the very end and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, how graciouſly and bountifully God will deal with all thoſe who have ſuffered or died for his Name, Word or Truth; when all the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Scripture ſhall be turned into Performances,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152396:14"/> and all thoſe things which he hath there ſpoken of, ſhall be made good, verified and fulfilled; then it will be found true and returned, <hi>That the Lord is very Piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of tender Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how little, yea, no Reaſon at all they had, who heretofore believed not in God, and truſted not on his Salvation; but when Perſecution or Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ariſe for the Word, they were offended. For hath God ſaid, and ſhall he not bring it to paſs? That whatever Trouble, Hardſhip, Inconvenience or Loſs any one ſhall endure for his ſake, or for his word, he will make it up unto them more than an hundred fold, in the time of the Reſtitution of all things. Yes, moſt aſſuredly he ſhall; <hi>and bleſſed are thoſe that believe, for there ſhall be a certain Performance of thoſe things which are told us from the Lord.</hi> This will be ſo clearly ſeen at the Diſtribution and Reſtitution of all things, that even the Souls of thoſe very ſame People who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were offended, when Perſecution or Tribulation did ariſe for the Word, will wiſh and exceedingly deſire that they had not been offended, but that they had cleaved and ſtuck unto that ſame Word ſtill, and herein followed the Lamb whetherſoever he goes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this ſame Lamb of God was at laſt <hi>brought to the Slaughter,</hi> Iſa. 53. 7. For they might have Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, yea, and gainfully reſt in what is called the Fooliſh Doctrine, of ſuffering according to the will of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 19. and have truſted on his ſtay, ſupport and inviſible Protection therein, and for thoſe future good things which God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>believeſt thou the Prophets, I know that thou believeſt,</hi> Acts 26. 27. So I now put you all to it, that ſhall hear or read theſe Lines, do you believe the Scriptures, I know that ſome of ye do believe them. And to ſuch of ye who do believe them, I have made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152396:14"/> known ſuch things from out of the ſame Scriptures (which ſhall be certainly fulfilled in their Seaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the exceeding benefit and ſweetneſs of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for God and his Word, that ſome of ye may be in love with Suffering, and ye could almoſt wiſh and deſire to experience, and be Partakers thereof your ſelves, whilſt you are in well-doing, as hearing his Word certainly is, or any way for the Word and Truths ſake. But as we are unwilling to truſt the iſſue and main event of a Battel, only to raw, freſh and newly diſciplined Souldiers, (there ſhould be much teaching and exerciſe, before they come to real Blows and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) although perhaps theſe may ſeem to ſhew more Heat and Forwardneſs, more Earneſtneſs and Courage than old Beaten Souldiers; yet ſtill there is not ſo much dependance to be had on the former ſort, as on the latter. So notwithſtanding, what warm Affections or Willingneſs to take up, and bear the Croſs, may ariſe in your Minds, yet I freely declare, that I ſhould be loth to truſt to your ſtanding unto it, if once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables or Officers were coming to diſmiſs this Aſſembly: For when once the Shepherd is ſmitten, or begun to be ſmitten, the Sheep will be ſoon ſcattered. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-Preſs alone, and of the People there was none with me,</hi> Iſa. 63. 3. ſaid the Captain of our Salvation. For when once they begin to be broken. and the Sparkles of Blood to fly, then the People will be ſure to keep far enough off.</p>
            <p>According to the Rules and Directions of God's written Word, and according to the Examples of the Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe Behaviour was when they were diſturbed and interrupted in their Aſſembling of themſelves together, they did not for all that, refrain or neglect the aſſembling of themſelves together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not act by way of Violence or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Noiſe or Confuſion; ſo ye ought to ſtand to it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152396:15"/> ſtill: Although after all that can be ſaid to perſwade ye unto it; yet ſeveral Hearers at ſuch a time of Trial, are like the Children of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who being harneſſed, and carrying Bows, turned themſelves back in the day of Battel.</p>
            <p>As God ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (which is to be underſtood of Chriſt and his Miniſters) <hi>Behold, I have made thee a Witneſs, and a Leader unto the People:</hi> So in a day of ſuch kind of Battel or Trial, the Miniſters and Preachers of the Word, are the Captains and Leaders who firſt ſtand in the Brunt; for commonly the Perſecution firſt begins with, and is levelled againſt them.</p>
            <p>My God who hath trained and exerciſed me on by little and little, hath now at length taught and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me how to behave my ſelf, even by <hi>Preaching in Priſon</hi> (ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19.) (which I did not underſtand ſo well at firſt, as I have done more lately: But by my former Ignorance of this kind, I have loſt ground, and I have not gained ſo much by Suffering as I might have done) and by ſpeaking out, and proclaiming the very ſame Words in Priſon, for which I have been impriſoned, Day after Day, and Night after Night, and by laying before them, and mentioning unto them, the exceeding ſinfulneſs, unreaſonableneſs, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof, as to futurity, which my Perſecutors ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves unto, in dealing thus injuriouſly, and opreſſively, and cruelly with me, only for my opening and alledging ſuch and ſuch things out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Law of the Moſt High God; that I hope by this time, the Sinners and Tranſgreſſors are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what afraid, leſt they ſhould be tormented yet more, when the time of their Puniſhment, and the day of their Calamity is come; ſo that my Perſecutors are well nigh wearied out (for ſometimes even their Hearts and Conſciences do recoyl within them) to put me much more, or hold me long in Priſon; ſo that I hoped I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152396:15"/> should have truſted on God in a way of Duty. I have ſeen a mighty and powerful effect of this my Preaching in Priſon: When the Goaler or Meſſenger's Wife hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bleſſed be God for it, this Scripture hath been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally fulfilled in me, <hi>The Mouth of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall deliver him,</hi> Prov. 12. 6. For my Mouth, whilſt I was in Priſon, only by ſpeaking words of Uprightneſs and Truth, hath cauſed, yea, and commanded Deliverance for me. And ſo I who underſtood thus much, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I who had experienced ſo much of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Protection and Deliverance herein; for I am now become an Old Souldier, whoſe Talent lies in Suffering, and not in outward Fighting; or rather in Fighting with the Sword of my Mouth, than with any outward Weapon; for I handle not Sword, Pike or Spear, but only the Pen of a ready Writer; I hope I ſhould have committed my Soul unto God in well-doing (which the Preaching and Miniſtry of the Word is) as unto a faithful Creator, not truſting in my ſelf (Remembring well the Story of that Boaſting Pſeudo Martyr in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days) but in God who giveth ſtrength and power unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and who would <hi>in the day I ſhould cry unto

               <hi>3dly,</hi> In thoſe who when Perſecution or Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth for the Word, are offended, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing wanting; and ſo their Souls are not ſet in order before they die. That is, they want the fear of God. <hi>And of whom haſt thou been afraid, or feared, that thou haſt lied, and haſt not remembred me, nor laid it to thy heart. Have not I held my Peace even of old, and thou feareſt me not,</hi> Iſa. 57. 11. The Holy Ghoſt hereby intimating, that ſuch who are afraid of Man, ſo that they do lie, or diſſemble, or commit any other ſin for to pleaſe and comply with Man, whoſe Rewards and Puniſhments are preſent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but they do not remember God, nor lay it to Heart; that is, think throughly and deeply of him. Becauſe God keeps ſilence, and holds his Peace now, all this is becauſe they fear not God. <hi>I, even I, am he that comforteth you: Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of Man that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man which ſhall be made as Graſs? and forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker, that hath ſtretched forth the Heavens, and laid the Foundations of the Earth, and hast feared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, becauſe of the fury of the Oppreſſor, as if he were ready to deſtroy, and where is the fury of the Oppreſſor?</hi> Iſa. 51. 13, 14. Perſecution or Tribulation, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have its deſigned Effect, which the Devil intends in raiſing and ſtirring it up, unleſs the People on whom it falls, did fear Man the viſible Inſtrument and Inflicter thereof, or ſome outward Evil to their Body or Eſtate, which that ſame Perſecution or Tribulation might bring on them. Now the intended effect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is, either to affrighten from Duty, or to put
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152396:16"/> a ſtumbling Block, and occaſion of falling, in the way of thoſe who are Perſecuted, as by committing of Sin, putting forth their Hands unto Iniquity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting with the Deed of them, partaking with their Perſecutors Sins, or ſuch like. But if in all theſe, and the like caſes and inſtances of Trial and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, People did not fear neither the Perſons of the Oppreſſors and Perſecutors themſelves, nor yet that preſent Evil and Inconvenience they would lay upon them, than as Chriſt Jeſus their Forerunner, <hi>(who in that himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is alſo able to ſuccour them that are tempted)</hi> ſaid upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other not much unlike Occaſion; inaſmuch as every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutionis a temptation: <hi>The Prince of this World cometh, and findeth nothing in me:</hi> So although the Devil is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe a ſtorm of Perſecution, Affliction and Tribulation againſt us, by ſuch of our Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his incarnate Inſtruments, yet ſeeing we know and are provided, and our Minds are armed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand againſt the worſt he or they can do, let him be never ſo wroth, and go out to make war with the Remnant of the Seed which keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and particularly. that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment in <hi>Acts 4. 19. We ought to hearken unto, and obey God more than Man;</hi> and ſo we ought to fear God more than Man, according to <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4, 5. As long as we have this inward Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this Strength and Reſolution of Soul, which is to <hi>have the Testimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> here it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Devil ſhould overcome them, or at leaſt not totally and finally.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge and Wiſdom of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, goes to the very bottom and Reaſon of things; whereupon it may be obſerved, that the Exhortation which therein is given, to confirm the Souls of the Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152396:17"/> this matter, that through much Tribulation they muſt enter into the Kingdom of God; I ſay, all that Exhortation runs and ſpeaks on this wiſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we ſhould <hi>fear God more, and fear Man leſs.</hi> This is the drift and deſign of thoſe two great Places in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 51. 13. and 57. 11. as alſo of that Command of Chriſt, in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. 5.

And what a fluid and uncertain periſhing thing, is that puff of Breath which is in his Noſtrils? Think throughly hereof, and then tell me, is this poor thing of Dying Man, a fit Object to make thee or any one to tremble, or thy Heart to ſhake? when perhaps, yea probably (for this is often the caſe of Perſecutors) himſelf trembles, and his Heart ſhakes at the apprehenſion of what God will do unto his Soul, when his Body ſhall drop as a Carcaſe into the Earth? Is this little and dying Man more to be pleaſed, than the Great and Ever-living God? in no wiſe, far be it from us. Ye do all now aſſent at the Hearing thereof, but they only do labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe God more than Man, who fear him and think on his Name.</p>
            <p>Let them who commit Sin, or omit Duty to pleaſe ſuch a Rich Man, or the like, take a Shovel or Spade, and go to the Grave of that Perſon after he is dead (in caſe the other ſurvives him) and dig there, to behold his Corps, and ſee what an ugly med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Stink, Corruption and Bones he made his Idol to pleaſe, whilſt it was in Life. A ſinful and ungrateful Wretch, that I ſhould ever diſpleaſe the Glorious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152396:17"/> and Immortal God for to pleaſe, gratifie, or comply with ſuch a little, vile and ugly Lump as this is. Or if we do but ſee and narrowly look upon, and conſider Man, as he lies upon his Dying-Bed, gaſping for the laſt Breath, almoſt choaked with Flegm, and when the ſhadow of Death ſits upon his Eye-lids, coughing and panting, and groaning, and fetching his Breath ſhort, till he breaths out the very laſt. And ſurely then ſuch muſt be aſhamed that ever made Man his Defence (who cannot preſerve and deliver his own Soul from flying out) or who to pleaſe, gratifie, comply with, or to get the favour and good Will of this dying Creature, hath contracted ſin and guilt in his Conſcience, incurred the wrath and diſpleaſure of the Lord God, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and abide on the guilty Soul, when all the gifts and benefits had from Man do periſh with him, and come to an utter and fearful End. This is certain, the more one knows of God, and of his infinite exceeding Greatneſs; All Nations before him (taken all together and much more ſo, then is a ſingle Perſon) are as Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers: The more we know or conſider of this, the leſs regard or reſpect we have unto Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is obſervable, that when the Prophet ſpeaks of the fear of the Lord, and of the glory of the Lord when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon immediately ſubjoyn'd, <hi>Ceaſe ye from Man whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Iſa. 2. 21, 22. intimating thereby, as if we ſhould draw off utterly, and quite abſtract from Man, in order to better apprehend and know the Greatneſs and Glory of God. As alſo his Spirit doth here tacitely reprove that Deference and over Eſtimation which hath been given unto Man in former Generations, and continues at this day. I ſpeak to your ſhame, for ſome have not the knowledge of God. But now in the latter days, very near drawing on, when the Lord ariſeth to ſhake terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152396:18"/> the Earth, people will then know better, that the Lord alone may be exalted in that day. That though Man who hath abounded in Riches or Power, hath heretofore been much ſet by and accounted of by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of their Fellow-Creatures. But this was their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; for the Riches, Power or Authority were not Man's but God's, even at that very time, altho' worldly People do not diſcern as much. And alſo there is ſo very little of intrinſick Good in worldly Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Rule, that even thereupon alſo Man is not to be accounted of. Chriſt will at length <hi>put down all Rule, and Authority, and Power,</hi> according to what is written. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. notwithſtanding now a days people make ſuch a ſtir and contention about it in the World.</p>
            <p>This is certain again, That the more like to God and to Chriſt any one is (this is true Religion to imitate him whom thou worſhippeſt, ſaid one of the Antients) The leſs Regard or Reſpect he hath to the Perſon of Men. <hi>And ſuch have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus Christ, the Lord of Glory with Reſpect of Perſons.</hi> James 2. 11. which Title, <hi>the Lord of Glory,</hi> is moſt appoſitely, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there put, becauſe ſuch of his faithful People who diſcern the Glory of Chriſt, that ſo infinitely much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth, will not much value any Glory of Men. It is thus written of Almighty God, <hi>He accepteth not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Men, nor regardeth the Rich more than the Poor, for they are all the work of his hands,</hi> Job 34 19. and of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, for thou regardeſt not the Perſon of men.</hi> Mat. 22. 16. Let this mind be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who did not regard the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men; That is, he would not commit Sin, nor neglect his Father's Buſineſs for the ſake of them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may, yea they ought ſo far not to regard the Perſons of Men, as not to conſent unto Sin or Evil out of Reſpect unto, or to pleaſe Men, nor yet to neglect
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152396:18"/> Duty, and in all things pertaining to God, <hi>to do as we uſed to do aforetime.</hi> Dan. 6. 10. according as his written Word, and the Dictates of our Conſcience being guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, do inſtruct us. Let men give what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Orders, or Forbiddings they will in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaining to Religion, in and amidſt all theſe, the Iſrael, that is, the true People of God know what they have to do.</p>
            <p>To preach againſt having Reſpect of Perſons, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing Man is not improper and unſeaſonable, as the World ſtands at this Day.</p>
            <p>For in the Souls of ſuch who have the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt with Reſpect of Perſons, or who have reſpect of Perſons, there is ſomewhat wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> That God-like Mind, and Chriſt-like Mind, as not to accept Perſons, nor regard the Rich more than the Poor, for they are all the work of his hands; for they are all Creatures of the ſame God. But this is one of the moſt abounding and ſpreading Sins of this Age and Nation, to reſpect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and idolize Man, which is crept in among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious alſo, to the Shame and Scandal of their Holy Profeſſion, and of their High and Heavenly Calling in Chriſt Jeſus; For almoſt all the Talk and Converſation abroad in the World, which the Underlings have with their Superiors, the Subſtantial and Rich People, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Gentlefolks, is to ſay as they ſay, and as they would have it, although it be in them to flatter, lye, and fain. It continues to be fulfilled at this day, <hi>They ſpeak vanity every one with his Neighbour.</hi> (Doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Talk and Converſation abroad in the World amount to much more than Vanity) <hi>with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they ſpeak.</hi> Pſal. 12. 2. in the Margent there; for a <hi>double heart,</hi> is, an heart and an heart; That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one heart in one ſort of Company, and another in another. But what doth all this tend unto? Or what will be the hurt and ill conſequent of it. It is ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152396:19"/> much Sin in the mean while, and will be puniſhment hereafter, according to what the Spirit of Truth ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that ſpeaketh proud things.</hi> Ver. 3.</p>
            <p>As it was ſaid, the more any one knows of God, and the more like any one is unto God, the leſs regard he hath to Man; So this ſtands upon Reaſon, for the Leſs muſt give way unto, and be ſwallowed up by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. One that is afraid of the roaring and devouring of a Lion, is not altogether ſo much afraid of the humming of a Stinging Bee; And ſo one who is afraid to ſtand in the Mouth of, and then to hear the Report of a Cannon loaden with Powder and deadly Bullet, yet he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo much afraid of a Popgun. Even ſo it is here, ſhould not his Excellency make us afraid? Should not the infinitely exceeding Greatneſs of God over Man make us much more fear God than Man; and ſo accordingly all they do as much fear him proportionably, who know and apprehend him by Faith.</p>
            <p>But ſay what thou wilt on this Subject, here is one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt it ſtill, for it is evident, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People fear Man more than God, becauſe the Puniſhment of Man is preſent and ſenſible, but the wrath of God is future and inviſible. Indeed the wrath of God in this Life is intelligible, and a little ſenſible and perceivable; but people do make a ſhift to harden and render themſelves inſenſate againſt it. Nevertheleſs, conſider the thing throughly, take the wrath of God as it will be in the length, ſeverity, and duration thereof, and then it is as much more to be feared than the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of Man, whoſe Fury ſoon vaniſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing, and the utmoſt he can do is <hi>to kill the Body,</hi> which is only to break the Husk or Shell, but not to touch the Man himſelf) as the vaſt Fabrick of the World doth exceed in Dimenſion the Bulk of one ſingle Man. When the Soul ſhall depart from the Body, then the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152396:19"/> 
               <hi>judgment written. Pſal.</hi> 149. 9. to be executed the vials of wrath will be then poured out. Then is it that the Souls of the Sinners and of the Guilty, will have a more terrible and laſting apprehenſion of the dreadful Majeſty and Preſence of God in coming <hi>near to them in judgment.</hi> Mal. 3. 5. and Puniſhment than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had of the appearance of his Angel on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or as the conſternation and fear we are now in amidſt the moſt dreadful Thunder and Lightining, in an horrible Tempeſt or Earthquake. For then the Soul will be <hi>Magor miſſabib, Terrour round about,</hi> all ſhivering and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding trembling and quaking; when alſo the torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſions ſhall be ſtretched out to the utmoſt, and ſhe will fear as much as is poſible to fear. What ſhall I ſay more? Even this, The more we fear God in this Life, the leſs we ſhall ſlaviſhly fear him in that which is to come, with that kind of fear which gendreth Bondage; which only will be the Portion of the Sinners, Wicked, and Ungodly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt; This ſhall be the portion of their Cup.</hi> Pſal. 12 6. And we cannot <hi>fear God greatly</hi> in this Life, as <hi>Obadiah</hi> did, That is, above and more than all things beſides, unleſs we know and apprehend him by Faith. <hi>And this is the victory that overcometh the World, even your faith.</hi> 1 John. 5. 4. This is the very Reaſon why ſome Elect People (The Lord add unto them how few ſoever they be, an hundred fold) do fear God more than Man, even their Faith; for ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he is the Great Law-giver, able to ſave and to deſtroy, that as he doth good, ſo he can puniſh. That he can, and alſo will, where he hath threatned ſo, inflict worſe, and more terrible, and evil things, than what Man now doth in his utmoſt rage and malice. <hi>But I will forewarn you, whom you ſhall fear; Fear him which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell; Yea, I ſay
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152396:20"/> unto you, fear him.</hi> So I ſay again, and teſtify the ſame over and over, <hi>fear God more, and fear Man leſs;</hi> and then ye will not be of that kind of Hearers, who when Affliction on Perſecution ariſeth for the Words ſake, immediately they are offended: Which Temper and Diſpoſition the Lord having ſhewed unto me by his Spirit, that moſt People are of; accordingly he hath directed, and put the foregoing Words into my Mouth, to fill and make up what is yet lacking and wanting in them, even the inward qualifications of Boldneſs, and Truſt on God, the Spirit of Knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. Let therefore the <hi>Spirit of the Lord reſt upon us,</hi> and let himſelf give unto us the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (whereby we ſhall be enabled to truſt on him) the <hi>Spirit of Counſel and of might</hi> (therein is included Courage and Boldneſs) the <hi>Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> Repent and do the firſt Works, that none of thoſe things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of, be found wanting in ye, leſt your Souls be not ſet in order before ye die, and they go out of theſe Bodies, as to which the time approacheth near, and is juſt at hand.</p>
            <p>As for my part, rather than go out all my Days in a courſe of Perfunctory outward Worſhip, or World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proſperity, I had rather be ranked among the number of thoſe to whom Chriſt ſhall ſay at the laſt Day, <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my Temptations, and I appoint to you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me,</hi> Luke 22. 28, 29. And I would to God, that your Minds have been worked into ſuch a good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved frame, by the things that have been ſpoken unto you out of the Book of the Lord, that ye will alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch your ſelves unto Chriſt, who is the word, (ſo that he who doth it for the Words ſake, doth it for Chriſt's ſake.) <hi>Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into Priſon, and to Death,</hi> Ver. 33. And then there is aſſured
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152396:20"/> and well-grounded Hope, if this firm, conſtant mind be in you; (for <hi>Peter</hi> who ſaid and boaſted this, his Faith did fail, and himſelf did flag and deny, when it came to an upſhot and Trial) that ſuch Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are <hi>willing to continue with Chriſt in his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (it is ſaid in the Plural Number, for the manifold kind of them) will inherit the Kingdom which he hath appointed. It is better (if the will of God be to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it ſo far) to die in a Priſon upon a Bed of Straw, and from thence go to Heaven, than to be <hi>cloathed in Purple and Fine Linnen, and to fare ſumptuouſly every day,</hi> Luke 16. 19. or to die on a Damask Bed in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and to go to Hell.</p>
